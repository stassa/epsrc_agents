%
%	Explanation
%	===========
%
%	Thelma performs an iterative deepening search for a _hypothesis_
%	that explains its training examples.
%
%	A hypothesis is a list of definite datalog clauses that may
%	include definitions of one or more invented predicates. The
%	depth of the search at each iteration corresponds to the _size_
%	of the hypothesis, defined as the number of all clauses in the
%	hypothesis.
%
%	This predicate is responsible for controlling the depth of the
%	search by incrementing the values of Clauses and Invented.
%
%	Clauses is the maximum hypothesis size at the current search
%	depth. Invented is the maximum number of clauses in all invented
%	definitions in the hypothesis at the current search depth.
%
%	Clause_Max and Invented_Max are the maximum number of all
%	clauses in the hypothesis and the maximum number of all clauses
%	of invented predicates in the hypothesis, in the entire search.
%
%	Clauses and Invented are first bound to Clauses=1, Invented=0
%	and then to that number plus 1 on each successive backtracking
%	into depth_level/4. The search exits without further
%	backtracking when Clauses is equal to Clause_Max and Invented
%	equal to Invented_Max, or when no more hypotheses can be found.

%!	program_signature(+Invented,+Target,+BK,-Predicates,-Constants)
%!	is det.
%
%	Construct the program signature for a learning attempt.
%
%	The _program signature_ is a list of predicate symbols that can
%	be used to form a hypothesis. This list consists of:
%	a) The symbol and arity of the target predicate, at its head.
%	b) The symbols and arities of invented predicates, following.
%	c) The symbols and arities of background predicates ordered by
%	lexicographic order, at the end.
%
%	Invented is the maximum number of all clauses in invented
%	definitions in a hypothesis in the current search depth.
%
%	Target is the symbol and arity of the target predicate.
%
%	BK is a list of symbols and arities of predicates to be used as
%	background knowledge for Target.
%
%	Predicates is the program signature. The order of symbols and
%	arities of background knowledge predicates in BK is ordered by a
%	call to order_constraints/3.
%
%	Constants is the list of constants in the Herbrand universe of
%	the background knowledge predicates, also ordered by a call to
%	order_constraints/3.
%
%	@tbd It is a little strange that this predicate returns the list
%	of constants, alongside the program signature. Perhaps the call
%	to order_constraints/3 can be be moved outside this predicate,
%	in the body of thelma/5. Then program_signature/3 can take the
%	resutling ordered list of BK predicates, add the symbols of the
%	target predicate and invented predicates to it, and return it.

%	metasubstitution is a Prolog coumpound, sub(Id, Ps). Id is the
%	name of a metarule in Metarules and Ps is a list of symbols and
%	arities of predicates in the program signature.
%
%	When prove/4 exits, each sub/2 term in the list of
%	Metasubstitutions is projected onto the corresponding metarule
%	to form a clause in a hypothesis. The hypothesis is later tested
%	for consistency with the negative examples in disprove/2 and
%	returned if it is consistent. This happens in thelma/5.
%
%	On backtracking, each list of metasubstitutions representing a
%	hypothesis that is correct with respect to the positive examples
